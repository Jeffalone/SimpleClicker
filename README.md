# SimpleClicker

Just a simple click bot made in Python. 

## Usage
Set key bindings in config.py:
  
PAUSE_KEY is used to pause autoclicking.  
START_KEY is used to start autoclicking.  
QUIT_KEY is used to exit program only when input is enabled.  
inputEnable sets if input is enabled one first run.  
When autoStop is set to True, autoclicking will automatically stop when the mouse moves after turning on clicking.  
  
Pressing PAUSE_KEY and START_KEY at the same time will stop clicking and disable keyboard input. This is useful when you do not want to accidentially trigger autoclicking.
